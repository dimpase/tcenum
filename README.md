The tcenum Coset Enumeration Package (version 0.1.1)
====================================================

The tcenum package implements Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration using the
HLT with lookahead strategy [1]. The package is based on programs developed
for work on my PhD thesis (1981-1985), and is presently composed of
a front end (written in C) for easy input of presentations which may
include Coxeter-type relations and a back end (written in Fortran)
to do the actual enumeration.

The current package has been developed only for Linux, and in particular
the bash shell, gcc compiler, and gfortran compiler.

Installing tcenum
------------------

Unpack the archive file in a chosen directory, move to the tcenum
subdirectory and run `tccompile`. The format for this command is

     tccompile [ <maxmib> [ <intbytes> ] ]

where `<maxmib>` is the maximum store in MiB available for the coset
enumeration (the default is 6000) and `<intbytes>` is the size in bytes
of an entry in the coset table (must be 4 or 8, the default is 4).

After running tccompile the executables will be in the directory 
tcenum/bin, which you should add to your PATH variable.

Running tcenum
--------------

The command to run tcenum is simply `tcenum`, which on its own produces
the usage formats:

    tcenum <presentation_file>
    tcenum <presentation_file> <maxc>
    tcenum <presentation_file> <maxc> <ilooka>
    tcenum <presentation_file> <maxc> <ilooka> <result_file>
    tcenum <presentation_file> <maxc> <ilooka> <result_file> <permgens_file>

The parameter `<presentation_file>` should be a file containing the
presentation and subgroup generators for the enumeration, in the format
described in the next section.

The parameter `<maxc>` is the maximum number of cosets the enumerator
is allowed to define, subject to there being enough given memory. This
should be an integer greater than 1 or the default value 0, which means
to use all of the given memory.

The parameter `<ilooka>` is the index increment at which lookahead takes
place.  This should be a positive integer or the default value 0, which
means to look ahead at index 2 and then every time the index is double
that when the last lookahead finished.

The parameter `<result_file>` should be a file to which the result of
the enumeration is appended. The default is that this is not done.

The parameter `<permgens_file>` should be a file to which a sequence
tc_permgens (in GAP 4 format) of permutation generators from the
final coset table is output. These "permutations" will be partial if
the enumeration was not successful. The default is that permutation
generators are not output.

The presentation format for tcenum
----------------------------------

The tcenum input should be in an ASCII text file in the format described
below.

The input has five main sections which should be terminated by full
stops as follows:

    <all generators> "." <generators not known to be involutions> "."
    <subgroup generators> "." <coxeter relations> "."
    <further relations> "."

Anything written after five full stops is ignored and can be used for
comments.

Here are two presentations for Alt(5) in this form (the first enumerates
over the identity, the second over the subgroup generated by `a` and `b`):

    AB.B...B3,(AB)5.  

    abc..a,b.a5b3c.(abc)5.

Throughout, blanks and linefeeds are ignored, commas and semicolons are
equivalent, and upper and lower case letters are distinguished. In
addition, in sections 1, 2, and 4, commas and semicolons are ignored.

The generators must be single letters and come from the set 
{"a","b",...,"z","A","B",...,"Z"}. Generators to be used are given
in the first section, where you must give at least one generator.

The generators  x  for which you do NOT want the assumption that  1=xx
should be put in the second section.

The third section contains words for the generators of the subgroup
over which you want to enumerate. These words should be separated by
commas (or semicolons).

We give the syntax for a word (in slightly extended BNF, 
where {} means repeat zero or more times):

    <word> ::= "" | <term> <word> 
    <term> ::= "1" | <factor> <power> 
    <factor> ::= <generator> | "(" <word> ")" | <commutator> 
    <commutator> ::= "[" <word> "," word {"," <word>} "]" 
    <power> ::= "" | <unsigned integer> | "-" | "-" <unsigned integer>
    <generator> ::= "a" | "b" | ... | "z" | "A" | "B" | ... | "Z"

Multiplication is denoted by juxtaposition, a factor is inverted by
following it with "-", and a factor is raised to the n-th power when
followed by the integer n. Commutators are left normed, so that
[a,b,c,...] means [[a,b],c,...].  A term consisting of just "1" is the
empty term, and so a word consisting of just "1" is the empty word.
Additions to the above syntax are that left parenthesis "(" and left
square bracket "[" are equivalent in words, as are ")" and "]".

The fourth section contains the Coxeter relations. If you do not want
any of the implications which follow then leave this section empty. If
a  and b  are generators, and  k  is an unsigned integer then  akb  in 
this section denotes the relator (ab)k.  If  a,b,c,d,...  are
generators, and  k,m,n,...  are unsigned integers then  akbmcnd...
is a shorthand for  akb bmc cnd ... .
Each unordered pair of generators should be specified in this
section at most once. If a pair a,b is not specified then the relator
(ab)2 is assumed. Specifying  a0b  means that no relator is entered or
assumed for the  a,b  pair.  Note: no assumptions or implications about
the orders of the generators are made in this section. Here is an
example presentation for the Weyl group of E6 (to be enumerated over
the Weyl group of D5):

    abcdef..a,b,c,d,f.a3b3c3d3e c3f..  

The fifth section is for relations which are not necessarily of Coxeter
type.  They should be separated by commas (or semicolons), and each
should be a word by itself (a relator) or an expression of the form
`<word>1=<word>2=...=<word>k`. This is translated to be `(<word>1)-1
<word>2,...,(<word>1)-1 <word>k`, so it is usually most efficient if
`<word>1` is a shortest word amongst `<word>1,<word>2,...,<word>k`. Here
is an example presentation for the sporadic simple group M11, for
enumeration over its subgroup M10:

    abcde..b,c,d,abcbae.
    a3b5c3d3e0c.
    a=(ce)2,(bcd)5.

Here is a presentation for the third Janko group J3, given in [2], 
to be enumerated over the subgroup generated by `ab`:

    ab.b.ab..
    1 = b3 = (ab)19 = [a,b]9 = ((ab)6(ab-1)5)2 
    = ((ababab-1)2abab-1ab-1abab-1)2 
    = abab(abab-1)3abab(abab-1)4ab-1(abab-1)3 
    = (ababababab-1abab-1)4.
